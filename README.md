# RSS-Feeds for De Gruyter Journals

[RSS Feeds] are a great way to keep track of new publications.
Unfortunately, De Gruyter has abolished their RSS feeds and do currently not intend to reintroduce them.
I have hacked together a web scraper that reads the single De Gruyter journal pages and transforms them into a simple `rss`-file.
This is all very basic an will probably break as soon as De Gruyter change their web layout.

The file [feed_list.csv](feed_list.csv) provides an overview of the RSS-feeds.

For the time being, the feeds will be updated daily.

Suggestions and feedback very welcome!
